# Browse the Model Directory

Here we are discussing how you can browse the models.

### Step 1

If this is the first time you are opening the app, then choose 'Start from Model'. Runway now opens to our home screen.

### Step 2

You should currently be able to see our home screen where we can browse models. If you cannot see this, then use the navigation bar on the left to select home. This icon is shown within the green box, and should be highlighted in blue to ensure you are on the right view.
