# Run Models in RunwayML

## Overview
If you're just getting started, check out our guide on [Using Models](https://learn.runwayml.com/#/how-to/use-models), for information about to find in RunwayML, set them up, run them, and stop them inside of the app -- no coding required!

What's the difference between a CPU and GPU? 

## Local CPU
To run models locally, you need to download and install them individually. Some **local** models require you to install Docker. Docker CE is a free and open-source software. Follow the steps in this guide to [Install Docker](how-to/run-models-locally.md) to run models locally.

?> You do not need Docker to run models remotely!

## Remote GPU
Running a model with Remote GPU [uses credits](https://support.runwayml.com/credits-and-plans/how-much-does-runway-cost), but the model runs much faster than when using your computer's local CPU. Some models are only available for Remote GPU and not available to download locally.
