# GPU's in the Cloud

Some of the models you may wish to run remotely (on the 'cloud') as opposed to locally, for example, to use a GPU for a model. Luckily we added the ability to do this!

In order to run remotely, use the toggle switch within your workspace. This allows you to choose if you want to run on your machine or run in the cloud. Here we see the toggle allows us to 'Enable Remote GPU'
