## What is Running Remotely?

Here we can run our models remotely. By running remotely it runs in the cloud, so not on your computer. Some advantages of running remotely are:

* You can use Runway with little processing power on your computer
* Get started quickly!
* No setup required
* Faster processing speeds by using our cloud GPUs
