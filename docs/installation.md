  <p>Enter your beta registered email.</p>

**Only users that received the beta invite mail will be able to follow the next steps.** If you signed up for the beta and haven't received an invitation yet please stay tuned! We will be rolling invites to the beta over the next few months. If you are an educator planning on using Runway for your class, please send us an email to [educators@runwayapp.ai](mailto:educators@runwayapp.ai).
 
Next, create your Runway account. Choose your `username`, a strong `password` and enter your first and last name. If you are planning on using Runway from an organization (company, school, NGO, Research Lab, etc) please enter the organization name.

Once your account has been created, you will need to verify the email associated with your account. Please check your inbox for a verification code we will send. Check your spam folder in case you don't receive a verification code after a few minutes. If you are having trouble please send us an email to [support@runwayapp.ai](mailto:support@runwayapp.ai)

  <p>Enter the Verification Code</p>
</div>

After verifying your account you are good to go! If you log out of your account you can enter again just by typing your email, username and password. **Note: You can login from different devices but only one active device per account is valid in the beta program.**
