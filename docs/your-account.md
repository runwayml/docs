## Upgrade Your RunwayML Plan
If you are a Training Experiments beta tester, access to Training Experiments is limited to a total five hours of training time. Upgrade to the **Creator Plan** in your RunwayML [User Dashboard](https://account.runwayml.com/) to train for more than five hours. With or without the Creator Plan, training time still uses [credits](https://runwayml.com/pricing). 

The Creator Plan also includes $10 in free credits, 25% bonus on new credit purchases, 8GB of active storage to save your datasets, and access to additional features as they are released.
