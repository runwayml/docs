One of Runway's main goal is to open the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to practitioners coming from various disciplines. Here we are defining AI as a broad term that relates to **systems that can simulate intelligent behavior in computers**. Machine learning is a ever growing field of research inside AI that uses **statistical techniques to give computers the ability to learn or improve the performance of a given task without explicitly programming a sequence of instructions.** Runway is a platform that allows you to explore in an intuitive an easy way these artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities.

## Models

A core component of Runway are ML models. In most cases a model is **an algorithm that performs a very specific task** in a highly specific way. A machine learning model is an algorithm who's rules where created by another algorithm.

For the most part, machine learning consists of a series of steps designed to generate models out of data points. A model is a machine-learned representation of the input data. Thus, a model created to recognize faces will first need to be trained on datasets of many different types of faces. Once trained, it should be able to recognize faces from pictures it has never seen before. This model is a highly abstract representation of the input data that is now able to recognize faces. In reality the process is a bit more complex. It involves collecting a large number of data points, creating training, validation and test data sets, choosing the right architecture, selecting the right hyper-parameters and then training your model using, if possible, a graphic processing unit (GPU) for faster results.

People have trained and built models for many different purposes, including models to recognize emotions, objects and people, body positions, hot-dogs, spam and sounds; models to generate photorealistic faces, captions, streets, facades, voices and videos of airplanes morphing into cats; models to detect cancer, malaria and HIV. Some trained models are ethically dubious and raise important questions about the social impact of algorithms and biases in our society such as models used to segregate neighborhoods or predict crime.

But not all models are not created equally. People build models in different programming languages, with different frameworks and for different purposes. Regardless of how they are built, these models are the most utilitarian aspect of machine learning, the thing that really matters in the end.

Reality is complex, so a model will never be able to completely mimic real phenomena. But we should pick a model that catches the broad strokes of behaviour. Keep in mind the famous words of the great statistician George Box: "*All models are wrong, but some are useful* ".
