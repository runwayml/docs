# Tutorial: Image Style Transfer (Adaptive Style Transfer)

In this tutorial, we will use the ["A Style-Aware Content Loss for Real-time HD Style Transfer"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.10201.pdf) model to transfer the particular style of a painter to an image of our choosing. This model captures the subtle style and nature of an artist by training on multiple paintings rather than on a single one.

###Â Requirements

- [RunwayML](https://runwayml.com/)
- An image file  

### Step 1

The first step is to select the model **Adaptive Style Transfer** from the Model Directory:

### Step 2

Next, add the model to a workspace from the top right side of the app.

### Step 3

If you haven't installed **Adaptive Style Transfer**, the bottom right button will prompt you to install the model.  **You need to have Docker installed in order to continue.**

?> Some models might be large so please note that downloading the model might take a couple of minutes. In this case, **Adaptive Style Transfer**  might take **4 to 8 minutes** to download depending on your internet connection.

### Step 4

To run **Adaptive Style Transfer** you will need download a `Checkpoint` for every style. `Checkpoints` are specific `Artifacts` that contain the information needed to apply a specific type of style to an image.

Search for the **Style Checkpoint** dropdown and pick the `Checkpoint` you want to use. In this case we will download and use the Van Gogh `Checkpoint`.

### Step 5

From the **Input** dropdown in the I/O View select the **File** option and choose an image. In this case, we will use a photo of a landscape by [Bailey Zindel](https://unsplash.com/photos/NRQV-hBF10M).

?> If you are running the model locally, we recommend to use reduce the size of the image for faster results.
