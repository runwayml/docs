Runway's main goal is to allow you, as creators to use AI. But what do we mean by AI?

AI is a widely used term nowadays. but here we are going to define it as being **systems that can simulate intelligent behavior in computers**. Machine learning is a ever-growing field of research inside AI that uses **statistical techniques to give computers the ability to learn or improve the performance of a given task without explicitly programming a sequence of instructions.** Runway is a platform that allows you to explore in an intuitive an easy way these artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities.
