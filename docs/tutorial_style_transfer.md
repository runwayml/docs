# Tutorial: Applying Style-Aware Content (Style Transfer) to an image. 

In this tutorial, we will the ["A Style-Aware Content Loss for Real-time HD Style Transfer"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.10201.pdf) model to transfer the particular style of a painter to any image we want. This model is able to capture the more subtle style and nature of an artist by training on multiple paintings rather than a single one.

###Â Requirements

- Runway Beta
- Docker (If you don't have Docker installed, please follow the installation instructions [here](/installation?id=download-docker).)
- An image file.  

### Step 1

The first step is to select the model **Adaptive Style Transfer** from the Model Directory:

?> Some models might be large so please note that downloading the model might take a couple of minutes. In this case, **Adaptive Style Transfer**  might take **4 to 8 minutes** to download depending on your internet connection.

### Step 4

To run **Adaptive Style Transfer** you will need download a `Checkpoint` for every style. `Checkpoints` are specific `Artifacts` that contains the information needed to apply a specific type of style to an image. 

Search for the **Style Checkpoint** dropdown and pick the `Checkpoint` you want to use. In this case we will download and use the Van Gogh `Checkpoint`.
