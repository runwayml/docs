# Generate

The pre-trained models in this category can generate synthetic outputs based on specific training data, such as photorealistic images and coherent text.

> **Note**: models are added to the RunwayML app often, and this page does not necessarily respresent the full list. Contributions, demos, and tutorials are welcome here!
