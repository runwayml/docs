# Models 101

- What is a model?
- Where to find models?
- Our Top Models to try out

Runway's core units are machine learning models. Machine learning models execute a series of rules to create a high level representation of some input data to solve a specific task. These rules are not designed by humans, but rather learned from the data the model is trained on. Thus, a model created to recognize faces will first need to be trained on datasets of many different types of faces. Once trained, it should be able to recognize faces from pictures it has never seen before. In reality the process is a bit more complex. It involves collecting a large number of data points, creating training, validation and test data sets, choosing the right architecture, selecting the right hyper-parameters and then training your model using, if possible, a graphic processing unit (GPU) for faster results.

People have trained and built models for many different purposes, including models to recognize emotions, objects and people, body positions, hot-dogs, spam and sounds; models to generate photorealistic faces, captions, streets, facades, voices and videos of airplanes morphing into cats; models to detect cancer, malaria and HIV. Some trained models are ethically dubious and raise important questions about the social impact of algorithms and biases in our society such as models used to screen job applicants or predict crime. People build models in different programming languages, with different frameworks and for different purposes.

Reality is complex, so a model will never be able to completely mimic real phenomena. But we should pick a model that catches the broad strokes of behaviour. Keep in mind the famous words of the great statistician George Box: "*All models are wrong, but some are useful* ".
