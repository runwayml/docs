# Installation

If you haven't yet downloaded Runway, then let's begin by getting you an [invite to download the app](https://runwayml.com/). You can do this through signing up on our list on [runwayml.com](https://runwayml.com/). Shortly after getting an email, you should receive a link to download Runway. Download the right version for your operating system.

?> If you encounter any problems or issues with the installation, please send us an email to [support@runwayml.com](mailto:support@runwayml.com).

?> The app will auto-update every time there is a new update available. You will also see a message at the top right corner of the app if an update is ready. There's no need to manually download the app again to receive updates.

<p class='note'><b>Note for Linux users</b>: You will need to configure Runway to run as an AppImage. Please follow <a href="https://discourse.appimage.org/t/how-to-run-an-appimage/80">this extra step</a>.</p>
