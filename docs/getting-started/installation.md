?> We enforce minimum password strength requirements to protect users from automated password guessing attacks. We strongly recommend using a [password manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager) like [1Password](https://1password.com/) or [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) (free) to generate and store cryptographically random passwords.

Click next and add your final details. If you are planning on using Runway from an organization (company, school, NGO, research lab, etc) please enter the organization name.

</div>

Once your account has been created, you will need to verify the email associated with your account. Please check your inbox for a verification code. Be sure to **check your spam or promotions folder** if you don't receive a verification code after a few minutes.

<div class="Img-Small">

  <p>Enter the Verification Code</p>
</div>

After verifying your account you are good to go! If you log out of your account you can enter again by using either your email or username and your password. You can login and logout from any computer, but only one instance of Runway can be running at any given time using a single user account.

?> The app will auto-update every time there is a new update available. You will also see a message at the top right corner of the app if an update is ready. There's no need to manually download the app again to receive updates.
