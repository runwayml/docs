If the issue persists or if you encounter any other problems during installation, please visit our [Support Center](https://support.runwayml.com/) or [contact us](https://support.runwayml.com/runway-explained/runway-support).

## Step 4: Set Username/Password
Create a new username and a strong password. Your username will be a unique identifier for your account and any models that you add to RunwayML.

?> We enforce minimum password strength requirements to protect users from automated password guessing attacks. We strongly recommend using a [password manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager) like [1Password](https://1password.com/) or [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/) (free) to generate and store cryptographically secure random passwords.

## Step 5: Add Your Details
Enter your first and last names. If you are planning on using RunwayML from an organization (company, school, NGO, research lab, etc.), please enter the organization name. Then, click **Create Account**.

</div>

## Step 6: Verify Your Email
Once your account has been created, you will need to verify the email associated with your account. Please check your inbox for a verification code. Be sure to **check your spam or promotions folder** if you don't receive a verification code after a few minutes.

?> If you still didn't receive a code you have two options: Send a message to [verification@runwayml.com](mailto:verification@runwayml.com) from the email address you used to register with RunwayML so we can verify that you own the address. We will then manually send you a verification code.
Or, register for a new account with a different email address.

<div class="Img-Small">
  <img src="assets/images/installation/login_05.png" alt="RunwayML Verification code" >
  <p>Enter the Verification Code</p>
</div>

After verifying your account you are good to go! If you log out of your account, you can enter again by using your email address or username along with your password. You can log in and log out from any computer, but only one instance of RunwayML can run at any given time using a single user account.

  <p>Account verified. All Set!</p>
</div>

## Updating RunwayML
There's no need to manually download the app again to update the software. If a new version of the app is available, RunwayML will automatically download the update in the background. Once the new version downloads, a message will appear in the top right corner of the app, and you will be prompted to restart RunwayML in order for new changes to take effect.

If you ever experience an issue with the auto-update feature, or you get stuck on a bad release, uninstall your current version of RunwayML and [download the latest version from our website](http://runwayml.com/download).

### Connectivity Issues
🌐 Using RunwayML requires an active internet connection. 

If you are experiencing any connectivity issues, please check that your firewall is configured to allow RunwayML.

?> __For Windows users:__ Make sure that RunwayML is allowed through the Windows Defender Firewall. To give RunwayML access to the internet: Go to `Start` > `Settings` > `Update & Security` > `Windows Security` > `Firewall & Network Protection` > `Allow an app through firewall`> `Select the RunwayML application`
