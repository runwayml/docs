Runway's main goal is to make accessible artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques to practitioners coming from various disciplines. Here we are defining AI as a broad term that relates to **systems that can simulate intelligent behavior in computers**. Machine learning is a ever-growing field of research inside AI that uses **statistical techniques to give computers the ability to learn or improve the performance of a given task without explicitly programming a sequence of instructions.** Runway is a platform that allows you to explore in an intuitive an easy way these artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities.
