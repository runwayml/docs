# Overview

Runway is a platform that allows creators of all kinds to use machine learning. Runway provides you with a simple way to use the latest machine learning techniques and algorithms in an intuitive way. In this documentation, we aim to help you get up and running with Runway.

- A dev API to run a headless version of Runway. *Coming soon!*

## Start Screen

Every time you open Runway you will see the **Start Screen**. Here you can choose to **Start from a Model** or restore a previous **Workspace** ([read more on workspaces](getting-started/views.md)).

## Home

**Runway's Home** is a unique place to search, discover, publish and install machine learning models. You can search for models with specific attributes, input types, creator, functionality or date.
