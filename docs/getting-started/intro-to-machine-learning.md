Runway's main goal is to make artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques to accessible practitioners coming from a wide range of disciplines. Here we are defining AI as a broad term that relates to computer systems that can simulate intelligent behavior. Machine learning is an ever-growing field of research inside AI that uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to learn or improve the performance of a given task without explicitly programming a sequence of instructions. Runway is a platform that allows you to explore these artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities in an intuitive and easy way.

### Models

Runway's core units are machine learning models. Machine learning models execute a series of self-learned rules to create a high level representation of some input data and therefore solve a specific task. These rules are not designed by humans, but rather learned from the data the model is trained on. Thus, a model created to recognize faces will first need to be trained on datasets of many different types of faces. Once trained, it should be able to recognize faces from pictures it has never seen before. In reality the process is a bit more complex. It involves collecting a large number of data points, creating training, validation, and test data sets, choosing the right model architecture, selecting the right hyper-parameters and then training your model using, high-performance dedicated hardware like a graphic processing unit (GPU).

People train and built models for many different purposes, including models to recognize emotions, objects and people, body positions, hot-dogs, spam email, and unique sounds; models to generate photorealistic faces, captions, streets, building facades, human voices, and videos of airplanes morphing into cats; models to detect cancer, malaria, and HIV. Some trained models are ethically dubious and raise important questions about the social impact of algorithms and biases in our society such as models used to screen job applicants or predict crime. People build models in different programming languages, with different frameworks, and for different purposes.

Reality is complex, so a model will never be able to completely mimic real phenomena. But models can capture and reproduce the broad strokes of generalizable behavior. As you venture down the exciting path of machine learning, keep in mind the famous words of the great statistician George Box: "All models are wrong, but some are useful".
