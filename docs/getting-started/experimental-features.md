# Experimental Features 🧪

Runway is currently in beta. This means that we are actively developing the application and things are in constant change. But one of the cool things about being in beta is that you get to try new features often! 👩‍🔬

This page contains descriptions of our current experimental features and details on how to use them.

## Active Experimental Features

- ### Chaining (release on beta version 0.6.11)

Since the release of the beta version 0.6.11, you can link multiple machine learning models together, allowing you to explore an even more extensive and comprehensive set of creative workflows.

Model chaining is a functionality inside Runway that allows you to use the output of one model as the input of another one, effectively chaining them together. This becomes very helpful when you want to create a continuous pipeline of processing for a given input. 

##### Things to keep in mind 🧠
- Not all models can be connected to one another. For example, if one model expects text as an input you'll only be able to send the output of a model that outputs text. 
- Be sure to run all models before expecting the final output!
