<h3 class="Main__Title">Introduction to Runway</h3>

<p class="Main__Description">Runway is a platform for creators of all kinds to use machine learning tools for their creative projects in an intuitive and easy way. Here you will find resources to get started with Runway quickly.</p>

Runway aims to make artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques accessible to creative practitioners from a wide range of disciplines. We define broadly define AI as a term that relates to computer systems that simulate intelligent behavior. Machine learning is an ever-growing field of research inside AI that uses statistical techniques to give computers the ability to learn or improve the performance of a given task without explicitly programming a sequence of instructions. With Runway, you can explore these artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities without any coding experience.

### Getting Started

Welcome! We are excited to have you here. If this is your first time visiting Runway, start with our [installation guide](getting-started/installation) and check out our brief [overview](getting-started/overview). After installing Runway, learn how to run and use models with our [tutorials](tutorials/tutorial_im2txt).

If you are interested in adding your own models to Runway, visit the [model importing](how-to/import-models) guide.

### Join Our Community

Runway has an active community of creators and contributors on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/runwayml/shared_invite/enQtNTE2MDg0ODY2MTAzLTc4ZGVkMzE2MjljYzM3ZDRlNjkyMjk4NDZjOWU1ZTRjOTA3N2Y1ZjFiNTJkZTAyMWE0MGZiZjdlMTA1NTdiMzc), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/runwayml), and [GitHub](https://github.com/runwayml).

We encourage everyone to:

* Share your [projects and creations](more/gallery.md)
* Learn more about the creative applications of machine learning
* Contribute tutorials, extensions, and models
* Shape the future of Runway
* Form collaborations
* Get involved in attending and/or running workshops

### Bring Runway to Your Classroom
We invite educators to join our pilot education program to provide students with the next generation of creative tools. Learn more and connect with us [here](https://runwayml.com/educators).

### Contribute to Runway
**Open Source Development**: Runway allows you to connect state-of-the-art machine learning models to third-party applications via open source extensions, plugins, libraries and add-ons. If you want to contribute to Runway's development, you can create and share your extensions and models with the Runway community. The official and supported OSS projects can be found in our [GitHub account](https://github.com/runwayml).

### Support
