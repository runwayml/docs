# Detect Objects

You can use models directly of inside the RunwayML app or interact with models through [network protocols](https://learn.runwayml.com/#/how-to/network). The pre-trained models in this category identify and label content. You'll find examples here for detecting objects, places, and people in real-time.  Visit [Projects Made with RunwayML](https://runwayml.com/madewith/) for ideas about how to use these models.

 
?> Models are added to the RunwayML app often, and this page does not necessarily represent the full list. Contributions, demos, and tutorials are welcome!
